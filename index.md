### EC ENGR 219: Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms

My complete implementation of assignments and projects in [***ECE219: Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms***](https://www.uclaextension.edu/engineering/course/large-scale-data-mining-models-and-algorithms-ec-engr-xlc-219) by UCLA (Spring, 2022).

**End-to-End Pipeline Classify News Articles:** Steps include feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, application of simple classification models, evaluation of the pipeline, and application of pre-trained models.
